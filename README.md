Welcome to the main dashboard for Artifact Virtual. This foundation is designed to evolve and expand as new systems and capabilities are introduced and interconnected. This project is more than a landing page: it is the central hub for Artifact Virtual‚Äôs growing ecosystem, built to support future integrations, research, and advanced features.

Currently, the dashboard is accessible worldwide via a secure Cloudflare tunnel. The long-term vision is to transition to a  production-grade deployment using SSL certificates and direct hosting on port 80, ensuring robust, secure, and seamless access. ISP limitations are being aggressively addressed to enable this transition.

Whether you‚Äôre contributing, deploying, or exploring, this repository is the starting point for Artifact Virtual‚Äôs journey toward a unified, extensible platform.

## Service Management & Resilience

This project uses a systemd service (`artifactvirtual.service`) for robust management. Services started via systemd will continue running even if you log out, disconnect your terminal, or close your SSH session. 

**Note:** If your computer goes to sleep or hibernates (e.g., lid closed), all processes‚Äîincluding systemd services‚Äîwill pause until the system wakes up. On wake, systemd will resume services automatically if configured with restart policies.



### Managing the Service

Use the provided `service.sh` script for easy management:

```bash
./service.sh start      # Start the service
./service.sh stop       # Stop the service
./service.sh restart    # Restart the service
./service.sh status     # Show service status
./service.sh logs       # Show live service logs
./service.sh enable     # Enable auto-start on boot
./service.sh disable    # Disable auto-start on boot
./service.sh test       # Test if site is accessible
```

For direct systemd commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl start artifactvirtual.service
sudo systemctl stop artifactvirtual.service
sudo systemctl status artifactvirtual.service
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start everything (nginx + cloudflare tunnel)
./start.sh

# Stop everything
./stop.sh
```

## What the start script does

1. üîç Kills any processes using port 8080
2. üåê Starts nginx on port 8080 serving the React landing page
3. ‚òÅÔ∏è Starts Cloudflare tunnel connecting to localhost:8080
4. ‚úÖ Verifies everything is working

## Access

- **Local**: <http://localhost:8080>

## Features

- **Modern React App**: Built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- **Blog System**: Integrated markdown blog functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with beautiful animations
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and social media cards
- **Performance**: Optimized bundles with code splitting

## Arc Simulation System

The `/arc_simulation` directory contains a Constitutional Intelligence System - a sophisticated multi-layer governance simulation with real-time dashboard capabilities.

### Constitutional Intelligence Architecture

The system implements three interconnected layers that create emergent governance patterns:

#### Core Components

- **ARC (Constitutional Layer)**: Blockchain-based constitutional law with evolving validation rules
- **ADAM Protocol (AI Governance)**: Intelligent rule evolution based on ethical observations and guilt tracking  
- **FUEL Network (Economic Substrate)**: Competitive agents in resource-constrained survival environment
- **LiveContextLoop**: Central coordination system managing cross-layer interactions

#### LiveContextLoop: The Coordination Engine

The `LiveContextLoop` class serves as the central nervous system, orchestrating complex interactions between all layers:

**Initialization Process:**
```python
# Creates single ARC-ADAM governance pair
self.arc = ArcSimulator(0)      # Primary constitutional chain
self.adam = AdamAgent(0)        # Primary governance AI  
self.fuel_sim = FuelSimulator() # Economic substrate (pre-instantiated)
```

**Step Execution Cycle:**
1. **Economic Foundation**: FUEL agents compete for resources, work, trade, and potentially die
2. **Constitutional Validation**: ARC processes new blocks against evolving validation rules
3. **Governance Intelligence**: ADAM observes patterns and triggers rule evolution
4. **Cross-System Feedback**: Economic stress influences constitutional strictness
5. **Event Resolution**: System-wide events are processed and logged

**Crisis Management:**
- Economic crises trigger every 50 steps OR when 2+ agents die simultaneously
- Crisis mode influences constitutional rule strictness
- ADAM Protocol responds to systemic stress with governance adaptations

**Emergent Behaviors:**
- Constitutional eras emerge from major rule changes
- Rule strictness cycles based on economic conditions  
- Governance learning through guilt accumulation and ethical observation
- Complex feedback loops between law, intelligence, and economics

### State Management

The simulation uses a comprehensive file-based state management system:

#### Control Files
- `simulation_data/control.json`: Controls simulation playback
  ```json
  {"play": true, "speed": 0.5}
  ```
- `simulation_data/reset.json`: Triggers simulation reset (auto-deleted after read)
- `simulation_data/latest.json`: Current simulation state data

#### State Data Structure
```json
{
  "step": 42,
  "fuel_alive": 6,
  "fuel_dead": 2,
  "fuel_avg": 75.3,
  "fuel_deaths_this_step": 1,
  "adam_scores": [12, 8, 15],
  "adam_guilt": [0.2, 0.8, 0.1],
  "adam_policies": ["liberal", "conservative", "moderate"],
  "arc_data": [
    {"arc_id": 0, "total_blocks": 150, "disputed_blocks": 3, "last_block_valid": true}
  ],
  "crisis_mode": false,
  "total_disputes": 2
}
```

### Running the Simulation

```bash
cd arc_simulation
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The system will:
1. Activate virtual environment
2. Start simulation daemon in background
3. Launch Streamlit dashboard at http://localhost:8501
4. Provide real-time visualization with play/pause controls

### Daemon Management

The simulation daemon (`demon.py`) runs continuously and:
- Steps through all simulation components
- Handles reset commands
- Manages state persistence
- Responds to play/pause controls
- Provides error recovery

## Logs

- Nginx errors: `/tmp/nginx_error.log`
- Tunnel logs: `/tmp/cloudflared.log`
- Simulation logs: Console output from `demon.py`
