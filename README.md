# ArtifactVirtual.com Landing Page

Professional React-based landing page hosted locally and served globally through Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Service Management & Resilience

This project uses a systemd service (`artifactvirtual.service`) for robust management. Services started via systemd will continue running even if you log out, disconnect your terminal, or close your SSH session. 

**Note:** If your computer goes to sleep or hibernates (e.g., lid closed), all processes—including systemd services—will pause until the system wakes up. On wake, systemd will resume services automatically if configured with restart policies.



### Managing the Service

Use the provided `service.sh` script for easy management:

```bash
./service.sh start      # Start the service
./service.sh stop       # Stop the service
./service.sh restart    # Restart the service
./service.sh status     # Show service status
./service.sh logs       # Show live service logs
./service.sh enable     # Enable auto-start on boot
./service.sh disable    # Disable auto-start on boot
./service.sh test       # Test if site is accessible
```

For direct systemd commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl start artifactvirtual.service
sudo systemctl stop artifactvirtual.service
sudo systemctl status artifactvirtual.service
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start everything (nginx + cloudflare tunnel)
./start.sh

# Stop everything
./stop.sh
```

## What the start script does

1. 🔍 Kills any processes using port 8080
2. 🌐 Starts nginx on port 8080 serving the React landing page
3. ☁️ Starts Cloudflare tunnel connecting to localhost:8080
4. ✅ Verifies everything is working
