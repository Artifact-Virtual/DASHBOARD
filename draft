- custom metrics and issues 

-pipe into frontend through simulation visualization
and analysis tools.
> This allows for real-time monitoring and adjustments based on the performance of the system.
> The frontend provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the data, making it easier to identify trends and issues.
> The integration of these tools enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling better decision-making and optimization of processes.
> The use of custom metrics allows for tailored performance indicators that are specific to the needs of the system and its objectives.
> This approach ensures that the system can adapt to changing conditions and requirements, providing a robust framework for ongoing performance evaluation and improvement.

- ability to add or remove arcs dynamically
> This feature allows for flexibility in the simulation, enabling users to modify the system's structure as needed.
> Users can add new arcs to expand the simulation or remove existing ones to streamline processes.
> This dynamic capability enhances the adaptability of the simulation, allowing it to evolve based on user requirements
> and changing conditions.
> The ability to dynamically adjust the arcs ensures that the simulation remains relevant and effective in addressing the needs of the users.
> It also facilitates experimentation with different configurations, providing insights into the impact of structural changes on the overall system performance.
> This flexibility is crucial for testing various scenarios and optimizing the simulation for different objectives.
